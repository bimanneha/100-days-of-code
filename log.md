Day 1: August 20. Tuesday
Today's Progress: Created a boiler plate project for Angular 8. Installed some basic dependencies like Bootstrap 4, Lodash which I will be using in my project.

Thoughts: Excited to start the actual coding tomorrow.

Link to work: Not Created Yet. Will share eventually, once I create it.
