Today's Progress: Created a boiler plate project for Angular 8. Installed some basic dependencies like Bootstrap 4, Lodash which I will be using in my project.

Thoughts: Excited to start the actual coding tomorrow.

Day 2: August 21. Wednesday
Today's Progress: Created a Login component wherein user enters username and password & gets in. Created a fake back end service that validates this credential. If found correct, user can move to Home Page. Used RxJS & JWT token authentication for this.

Thoughts: Need to explore more around RxJS.
